Cinemarco’s Quality Reservation System (CQRS 😅)
Practice with finding and coding Value Objects, Entities, Repositories and Aggregates 🎁
Scenario: Online Reservation
  The user selects the day and the time when he/she would like to see the movie.
  The system lists movies available in the given time interval - title and screening times.
  The user chooses a particular screening.
  The system gives information regarding screening room and available seats.
  The user chooses seats, and gives the name of the person doing the reservation (name and surname).
  The system gives back the total amount to pay and reservation expiration time.
Additional behaviour
  The system covers multiple cinemas all over Europe with multiple rooms (multiplex).
  Seats can be booked at latest 15 minutes before the screening begins.
  There are three ticket types: adult, student, child with varying prices.
  3D Movies and D-Box Seats cost extra. For students the price gets percentually reduced.
Covid-19 bonus round
  There must be at least be a single place left over in a row between two already reserved places.
